Last night I had a beer with some old friends and colleagues.

We were discussing a particular library and one of us explained he recently found patches from almost all of us in the git history.

And the he said (I'm paraphrasing a little):

> Software lives in the heads of the people who wrote it. Code and documentation are nothing but
> distant echoes of their thoughts at a given time.

I could not agree more.

Code is all but a means to an end, try and remember that.

Cheers!
