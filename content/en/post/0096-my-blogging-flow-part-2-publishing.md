Welcome to part 2 of "How this blog gets written". If you haven't already, feel free to read [part 1]({{< relref "0095-my-blogging-flow-part-1-under-the-hood.md" >}}) first :)

# The Idea

Everything starts with an idea. I have a small git repository on my dedicated machine which contains a bunch of markdown files, one per article. (This repository is private by the way).

The contents of these files can vary from just a few lines to an almost complete article. Most of the time they only contain a basic outline though.

I update the `ideas` repository as soon as ideas come. It's important to write things down as soon as possible. Forgetting what you wanted to say or how you wanted to say it happens far more quickly than you would think.

# The first draft

Next, it's time to start writing the full article. I have a small Python script which:

* finds out the next article number and fill up the front matter for me (because I'm lazy)
* runs `git add` on the generated Markdown file so I don't delete it by mistake by running `git clean` (because mistakes happen)
* opens the Markdown file in my text editor

Now it's time to draft the article. I've configured my editor so that:

* spell checking is activated
* syntax highlighting is disabled (I've explained why [in a previous blog post]({{< ref "/post/0087-syntax-highlighting-is-useless.md" >}})).

In an other terminal (usually hidden behind a tab), I have `hugo serve` running, and finally, next to the text editor, a web browser, so that I can see the changes happening in real time.

# Proofreading

And then it's time to proofread, proofread, proofread ...

I usually wait for a good night's sleep before re-reading an article.

If the article is really big and complex, I sometimes open a pull request on GitHub and ask friends or colleagues to review it.

I do my proofread both in my text editor and in the browser, to increase the chance I'll see spelling errors, awkward formulations, transitions problems and the like.

# Publishing

I have another Python script to automate publication. Here's what it does:

* make an automatic commit in case I forgot (the script just skips this part if the repository is clean)
* run `hugo --buildDrafts=false` to build the HTML files
* run `rsync` to upload them to my server
* run `git push` to publish changes to GitHub

Note that the publishing of a new post triggers a new version of the blog' feed to be written.

This script can be run after any corrections to an already published article.

When a brand new article has just been published, I run yet an other Python script to:

* Parse the RSS feed and find out the URL and title of the latest article
* Write an automatic tweet like [this one](https://twitter.com/d_merej/status/1092029859864416259) (the additional hashtags at the end are given on the command line)
* Write a toot on mastodon with similar content
* Send an email to the people who subscribed to [the newsletter]({{< ref "/post/0031-introducing-dmerej-newsletter.md" >}}). I manually maintain a list of subscribers inside a configuration file for now, since there's no subscription form on the blog.

# dev.to

Then it's time to wait until `dev.to` picks up the latest version of the RSS feed, parses the HTML from the feed, converts it back to markdown and add it into my dashboard.

(Yup, you can configure `dev.to` to do this!)

This works quite well given the weird round-trip through HTML. Still, I have to re-read the markdown created by the dev.to importer just in case. This gives me a final opportunity to proofread the article one last time.

# Feedback

Thanks to isso I get notified when new comments are posted. I also of course get notifications from dev.to.

When I'm lucky, [@thepracticaldev](https://twitter.com/thepracticaldev) tweets a link to my article, and I get new followers and more views. This is nice :)

That's all folks! If you have any other questions regarding how the blog works, don't be afraid to ask in the comments below!
