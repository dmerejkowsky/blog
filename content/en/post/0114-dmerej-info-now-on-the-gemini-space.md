Hi there,

Just a quick note to let you know my personal website is now available on the Gemini space too.

Get a [Gemini client](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html) and see you at [gemini://dmerej.info](gemini://dmerej.info)

But Why?

# 1. Because I can

Because I can! - classic geeky answer I know.

I've been hosting my own server on the Web for quite some time, and it's much, much easier to set up a Gemini server. So, feel free to give it a go yourself.

# 2. Because of what Gemini stands for

The second reason is that I like what Gemini stands for.

As per the FAQ:

> Gemini may be of interest to people who are:
>
> * Opposed to the web's ubiquitous user tracking
> * Tired of obnoxious adverts, auto-playing videos and other misfeatures
> * Interested in low-power computing and/or low-speed networks

I'm interested in the first two for philosophical and political reasons.
I care a bit less about the last one, but it's a nice touch (think of
the environmental reasons).

# 3. To produce more content

To cite the FAQ:

> Gemini already has a surprising number of client and server implementations in existence [...], but the real shortage right now is not of software but of content [...] The greatest contribution you can make to the project is to be a part of this process.

So, enjoy about 100 articles spanning 4 years!
