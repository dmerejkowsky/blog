TL;DR: [vim-ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) is awesome and you should give a try!

# Introduction: the rise of linters

I've [already blogged]({{< ref "/post/0037-how-i-lint-my-python.md" >}})
about linters and how I use them when I write Python code.

Let's recap:

* I have a shell script call `lint.sh` which calls several linters. One for the
  style only, and several for static analysis.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -xe

pycodestyle .
python bin/run-pyflakes.py
python bin/run-mccabe.py 10
pylint mymodule
```

Note that the script runs the fast linters first (`pycodestyle` and `pyflakes`
are pretty fast), and ends by running `pylint`, which can get pretty slow on
big code bases.

* I use: `:set makeprg=./lint.sh`
* I type: `:make` when I'm done writing code.
* I wait for script to finish (Neovim can't be used for editing while the
  *makeprg* program is running)
* I use the quickfix window to fix lint errors.


This works quite well for me when I'm using Python because:

* I know the code style pretty well so I rarely have style errors
* For me running `pylint` is as slow as running tests, and I'm used to have
  tests running synchronously too.
* I like using the `quickfix` window (thanks to the very nice
  [vim-qf](https://github.com/romainl/vim-qf) plug-in by the way)

But some time ago at work, we all start working on some JavaScript code.

We use [eslint](http://eslint.org) for code style,  [flow](https://flow.org/)
for type checking, and [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) plus [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for tests.

And since we're using [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for hosting our source
code, we of course have a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to run all of these for each
merge request.

# Shortcomings of the makeprg approach

At first I tried using the same work flow as with Python, but I quickly face
some issues.

## Finding the binaries to run

Knowing which binary to use for the linting program can be hard. Sometimes you
can use the one that is in your `$PATH`, but sometimes you want the binary
that is in `node_modules/.bin`

## Learning the style convention

Our `eslint` configuration is quite strict. (It's based on the one from
[Air B&B](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) if you're curious),
and I'm not used to JavaScript yet, so I constantly had style issues and it was
frustrating to have my merge requests blocked because I forgot to run
`:make`  and had a bunch of style problems.

## The errorformat

For Neovim to populate the quickfix window, it has to parse the output of the
linters programs.

By default, `eslint` output looks like this

```console
$ eslint foo.js
/path/to/foo.js
  1:5   error  'foo' is assigned a value but never used          no-unused-vars
  3:10  error  'bar' is defined but never used                   no-unused-vars
  5:1   error  Expected indentation of 1 tab but found 2 spaces  indent

✖ 3 problems (3 errors, 0 warnings)
  2 errors, 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

It's very pretty (and I did not even show you the nice colors!), but you can see
it's a bit hard to parse for other programs. [^1]

The solution is to use the `--format` option like this:

```console
$ eslint --format compact foo.js
/path/to/foo.js: line 1, col 5, Error - 'foo' is assigned a value but never used. (no-unused-vars)
/path/to/foo.js: line 3, col 10, Error - 'bar' is defined but never used. (no-unused-vars)
/path/to/foo.js: line 5, col 1, Error - Expected indentation of 1 tab but found 2 spaces. (indent)

3 problems
```

But by default Neovim expects an output exactly like gcc[^2]
```console
$ gcc foo.c
foo.c:3:3: error: ‘a’ undeclared (first use in this function)
foo.c:4:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘foo’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
```

(No 'line' and 'col' , and no commas)

So in order for the line numbers and columns to be parsed correctly you have to
use a variable called `errorformat`

```vim
let errorformat =
        \ '%f:%l:%c: %trror: %m,' .
        \ '%f:%l:%c: %tarning: %m,' .
        \ '%f:%l:%c: %tote: %m'
```

It's pretty hard to get right, even if you [read the documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/quickfix.html)
(chapter 7, the "The Error Format")

## Running synchronously

Last but not least, all the linters ran quite fast (even `flow`, because it uses
a background server under the hood).

So it was also painful to have the editor unresponsive for the few seconds it
took for all the linters to run.

# Switching to vim-ale

After hearing good things about [vim-ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale),
I decided to give it a try, and I was *very* pleased to notice it was able to
run `eslint` and `flow` in our JavaScript project with *zero* configuration!

This is how `vim-ale` works by default:

* First, get the current `filetype` (This is done by Neovim itself [^3]), in our
  case `javascript`
* Then, look for files in the matching [ale_linters folder](
  https://github.com/w0rp/ale/tree/master/ale_linters) to get a list of
  potential linters.
* Then, after a small time of inactivity (200ms by default), run all the linters
  found in the previous step, concurrently and in the background.
* Then, parse the output of all of them and use the *sign gutter* to display
  problematic lines, like this:

![vim-ale gutter signs](/pics/vim-ale-gutter.png)

Notice the red angle brackets in the column on the left, and the detailed
message on the bottom.

Also, by default the whole gutter will disappear when there's nothing found by
the linters, which allows you to instantly know you're done fixing lint errors.

## Simple customization

After reading [vim-ale
documentation](https://github.com/w0rp/ale/blob/master/doc/ale.txt), I was able
to tweak a few details:

I prefer having the linters run only after I save the file, not continuously,
otherwise I find it too distracting:

```vim
let g:ale_lint_on_text_changed = 'never'
```

I also don't like the linters to run right after I open a file:

```vim
let g:ale_lint_on_enter = 0
```

## The location list

By default, `vim-ale` uses the so called *location list*. It looks pretty
much like the *quickfix window*, but:

* There's one location list per window, whereas the *quickfix* is global.
* The location list is destroyed as soon as the window is closed
* You can use the same bindings to navigate the location list, using a `l`
  prefix instead of a `c`. (For instance `lprevious` and `lnext` instead of
  `cprevious` and `cnext`)

At first I was tempted to configure `vim-ale` to use the quickfix window instead
(which can be done by setting the `g:ale_set_quickfix` variable), as I was doing
for Python, but I've decided to try and let `vim-ale` use the location list for
several reasons:

* I've heard about the location list for quite some time, but I'd never actually
  use it, so I was curious and wanted to know if it could fit in my workflow.
* I already used the quickfix window with `:grep` and other tools and I did not
  like having it replaced by `vim-ale` all the time.

## Custom mappings

I was already used to type `:cp`, `:cn` and `:cr` (:`cprevious`, `:cnext` and
`:crewind`) to navigate the quickfix list, but it turned out it was harder
to use their location list counterparts:

* `:ln` cannot be used for `:lnext` because it actually is used as a shortcut
  for `:lnoremap`
* I use the [Dvorak layout](https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/) on my keyboard,
  and typing `ln`, `lp` or `lr` is much harder to type than `cn`, `cp` or `cr`
  there.

Now, Neovim has this concept of "leader" key you can use to prefix all your
custom mappings.

I'm using "comma" for this, instead of the default (backslash), that I find hard
to type.

So of course I could have used a `<leader>` mapping for the location list
command, but it unfortunately `<leader>p`, `<leader>n`, and `<leader>r` were already taken.

That's when I remember someone suggesting using "space" as a leader key, and so
I used:

```vim
nnoremap <space>l :lnext<CR>
nnoremap <space>p :lprevious<CR>
nnoremap <space>r :lrewind<CR>
```

Note: this means I can no longer easily use the space bar in normal mode, but by
default all the space key does in move the cursor forward, so it's not a big
deal.

## Back to Python

As I describer earlier, `vim-ale` is pretty smart, and comes pre-configured with
the `pylint` and `pyflake`  linters.

This means that every time I was saving code in a Python file, `vim-ale` would
find `pylint` and `flake` in the *virtualenv* or in the PATH, and run them with
the default options.

It's not what I wanted, but it was easy to turn in off:

```vim
let g:ale_linters = {
  \ 'python': [] ,
  \ }
```

(Configuration of the `ale_linters` dictionary is a bit weird: it assumes you
want to run *all* the linters for *every* filetype, so you have to define some kind of
"blacklist" to turn off the linters you don't want to run)

But by then I started to miss having the style being checked after each save.

(This is what happens when you start using great tools: you wish you can use
them all the time [^4])

Unfortunately, `vim-ale` did not know about `pycodestyle` so I had to patch the
code of the plug-in.

## Adding a vim-ale linter

In our case the `pycodestyle` output looks like this:

```console
$ pycodestyle foo.py
foo.py:4:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
```

There's the filename, the line, the column, a short code (`E302` in the
example), and a detailed message (*expected 2 blank lines, found 1*)

So I started adding a new file in code in `ale_linters/python/pycodestyle.vim`

Here are the relevant parts:

```vim
" By default, use `pycodestyle` from path, unless it is set
" in the `g;ale_python_pycodestyle_executable` variable:
let g:ale_python_pycodestyle_executable =
\   get(g:, 'ale_python_pycodestyle_executable', 'pycodestyle')

" Look for pycodestyle in the virtualenv, and only if not found
" in it, default to the previously set pycodestyle executable:
function! ale_linters#python#pycodestyle#GetExecutable(buffer) abort
  ...
  if !ale#Var(a:buffer, 'python_pycodestyle_use_global')
    let l:virtualenv = ale#python#FindVirtualenv(a:buffer)

    if !empty(l:virtualenv)
      let l:ve_pycodestyle = l:virtualenv . '/bin/pycodestyle'

      if executable(l:ve_pycodestyle)
        return l:ve_pycodestyle
      endif
    endif

  endif

  return ale#Var(a:buffer, 'python_pycodestyle_executable')

endfunction

" Get the full command line to run: append contents from the
" python_pycodestyle_options variable if it exists:
function! ale_linters#python#pycodestyle#GetCommand(buffer) abort
    return fnameescape(ale_linters#python#pycodestyle#GetExecutable(a:buffer))
    \   . ' ' . ale#Var(a:buffer, 'python_pycodestyle_options')
    \   . ' %s'
endfunction

" Register pycodestyle as a linter for the `python` filetype:
call ale#linter#Define('python', {
\   'name': 'pycodestyle',
\   'executable_callback': 'ale_linters#python#pycodestyle#GetExecutable',
\   'command_callback': 'ale_linters#python#pycodestyle#GetCommand',
\   'callback': 'ale#handlers#python#HandlePyCodeStyle',
...
\})
```

You'll notice everything is done with callbacks to get the path to the
executable, the full command line, and how to parse the output.

And here's the implementation of the `pycodestyle` output parser.

```vim
function! ale#handlers#python#HandlePyCodeStyle(buffer, lines) abort
    " Regular expression to match messages:
    " They look like:
    " <file>:<line>:<col>: <code> <detailed text>
    let l:pattern = '\v^[a-zA-Z]?:?[^:]+:(\d+):?(\d+)?: \[?([[:alnum:]]+)\]? (.*)$'

    " For each match, update the l:output list:
    let l:output = []
    for l:match in ale#util#GetMatches(a:lines, l:pattern)
        let l:code = l:match[3]

        call add(l:output, {
        \   'lnum': l:match[1] + 0,
        \   'col': l:match[2] + 0,
        \   'text': l:code . ': ' . l:match[4],
        \})
    endfor

    return l:output
endfunction
```


You'll note it's done by writing "real" code (it's still `vimscript`, though)
with helpers functions, instead of trying to set a weird `errorformat` option,
with hard to read syntax.

And that's all there is to it. All I had to do was to set the `ale_linters`
dictionary to only run `pycodestyle`:

```vim
let g:ale_linters = {
  \ 'python': ['pycodestyle'] ,
  \ }
```

and then I could keep using `:make` and the quickfix window for the slower
linters like `pylint` like I used to :)

# Conclusion

`vim-ale` requires very little configuration to work out of the box. The
asynchronous features are really nice (and they work both in Neovim and Vim 8).
It has tons of customization options, and last but not least, new linters are
easy to add and customize.

I highly recommend  you give it a try.

Cheers!
