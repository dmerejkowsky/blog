Here are a few ways to contact me. Note that I follow the [Croker's Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html), so feel free to speak up!

## e-mail


Here's my e-mail, encrypted with a very secure algorithm:

```text
qvzvgev@qzrerw.vasb
```

If you can't decrypt this, feel free to leave a comment anywhere with your
e-mail address and I'll get back to you.


## Comments

Comments on this blog are powered by [isso](https://posativ.org/isso/).
Here are a few things you need to know:

* Your comments are stored (hopefully safely) on my server. I make regular
  backups.
* Sorry, you can't see them if you choose to block JavaScript. (This has the
  nice effect of greatly reducing spam, without using CAPTCHAs)
* When you leave a comment, you have the choice to fill the 'e-mail' field.
  I won't share it with anyone, and I'll use it to contact you directly if
  needed. But please note that you *won't* get automatic notifications by mail.
* After you submit your comment, you'll have 15 minutes to edit or delete it
  (If you are wondering, this works with a secret token stored in a cookie).

## Suggest an edit

At the top of each article, you'll find a link allowing you to suggest an edit on Github.
This is what works best *for me*, but you are free to use any method that works best *for you*.
I'm always grateful when attentive readers allow me to improve my work!
