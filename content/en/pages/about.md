My name is Dimitri Merejkowsky (not to be confused with the Russian author with
the same name :)

I've been writing software for quite sometime now, and I've always liked
sharing knowledge and learn from others, which is why I created this
blog.

I like Python, Rust, writing tests and put sticky notes on white boards.

I'm also a teacher and a coach, so  don't hesitate to [get in touch]
({{< ref "/pages/contact.md" >}})
