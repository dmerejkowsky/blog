My name is Dimitri Merejkowsky (not to be confused with the Russian author with
the same name :)

I've been writing software for quite some time now, and I've always liked
sharing knowledge and learn from others, which is why I created this
blog.

I mostly program in Python and Rust, and I like solving problems using
collective intelligence (usually by putting sticky notes on white boards).

I'm also a teacher and a coach, so  don't hesitate to [get in touch]({{< ref "/pages/contact.md" >}}).
