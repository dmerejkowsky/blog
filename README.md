# My toolbox

You can find here the configuration for most of the tools I use.

# How to use this repo

I've decided to publish my toolbox on the Internet because it's
convenient when I need to share a snippet of config with someone else.

However, I strongly advise you to **not to use this repo directly** on
your own machine or otherwise and to *not* fork it.

Instead, take the time to study what the code does, and only then
copy/paste it into your *own* configuration files.

Cheers!
