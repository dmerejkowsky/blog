# About this fork

This is where I keep the modifications I've made to the [original theme by Munif Tanji](https://minimo.netlify.com/).


Feel free to take a look at the changes and re-use them if you like but please note:

* I'm not really good at front-end dev, so most of them are ugly hacks
* Some parts of the theme requires stuff in the blog and vice-versa
* The original theme may contain bug fixes I was too lazy to backport

Thus, I highly recommend you **don't use it** directly with you own blog.

Instead, I suggest you:


* Create your own, personal fork of the original theme
* Take at my patches one by one, consider if you need them, then apply them in your fork if required

That way we can both keep our sanity.

Thank you for your understanding.
